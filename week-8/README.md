 Project Structure
Part 1: Data Loading and Basic Exploration

COVID19ResearchAnalyzer class: Main analyzer with methods for each task
load_data(): Loads the metadata.csv file
explore_data(): Provides comprehensive data exploration including:

Dataset dimensions
Data types
Missing values analysis
Basic statistics



Part 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation

clean_data(): Handles data preprocessing:

Fills missing values appropriately
Converts dates to datetime format
Extracts publication year
Creates word count features for titles and abstracts
Filters data to reasonable year range (2019-2024)



Part 3: Data Analysis and Visualization

analyze_data(): Performs key analyses:

Papers by publication year
Top publishing journals
Most frequent words in titles
Source distribution


create_visualizations(): Creates 6 comprehensive visualizations:

Publications timeline
Top journals bar chart
Word cloud of titles
Source distribution pie chart
Abstract word count histogram
Top words frequency chart



Part 4: Streamlit Application

create_streamlit_app(): Full-featured interactive dashboard with:

File upload interface
Year range filtering
4 organized tabs:

Overview: Key metrics and insights
Visualizations: Interactive charts and word cloud
Data Sample: Customizable data preview
Statistics: Detailed statistical summary


Data export functionality



ðŸš€ How to Use
Option 1: Run as Streamlit App (Recommended)
bash# Save the code as covid_analysis.py
# Install required packages
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn wordcloud streamlit

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run covid_analysis.py
Option 2: Run as Console Application
python# Modify the last part of the code to use main() function
# Run directly with Python
python covid_analysis.py
ðŸ“¦ Required Libraries
bashpip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn wordcloud streamlit
ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

Robust Error Handling: Handles missing data and edge cases
Interactive Dashboard: User-friendly Streamlit interface
Comprehensive Analysis: Covers temporal, journal, and text analysis
Professional Visualizations: Publication-ready charts and graphs
Data Export: Download cleaned data for further analysis
Flexible Filtering: Interactive year range selection
Modular Design: Clean, reusable code structure

ðŸ’¡ Tips for Using the Application

Data Source: Download the metadata.csv file from the CORD-19 dataset on Kaggle
Memory Considerations: The full dataset is large. If you encounter memory issues, you can modify the code to load only specific columns:

pythoncols_to_load = ['title', 'abstract', 'authors', 'journal', 'publish_time', 'source_x']
df = pd.read_csv(file_path, usecols=cols_to_load)

Customization: The code is modular and can be easily extended with additional analyses or visualizations.
Performance: For large datasets, consider adding data sampling or chunking capabilities.

This implementation provides a complete solution for analyzing COVID-19 research trends, with both programmatic and interactive interfaces. The code follows best practices with clear documentation, error handling, and a professional structure suitable for both learning and production use.
